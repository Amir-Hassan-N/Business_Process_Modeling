# Business Process Modeling and Workflow Analysis for Art School Management (Intermediate - Advanced) | BPMN & Petri Nets


 ◉ Developed a structured business process model to optimize student enrollment, course selection, and lesson management at an art school using BPMN and Petri Nets.

 ◉ BPMN Process Modeling: Designed a complete process choreography using BPMN, visualizing interactions between students, instructors, and the info office. Implemented negotiation loops, payment processing, and workflow optimizations for seamless operations.

 ◉ Process Variants & Optimization: Modeled an alternative scenario where students can enroll in a new course after completing a previous one, enhancing process flexibility and improving user experience.

 ◉ Petri Nets Implementation & Validation: Converted BPMN diagrams into Petri Nets, ensuring workflow soundness, liveness, and proper completion. Conducted structural analysis, reachability tests, and coverability graphs using WoPeD and Woflan tools.

 ◉ Performance & Findings: Identified bottlenecks in draft submission and payment handling, improving process efficiency through parallel execution strategies. Verified workflow correctness by ensuring deadlock-free and bounded models.

 ◉ This project demonstrates expertise in business process modeling, workflow optimization, and formal verification techniques for process automation in educational management.
